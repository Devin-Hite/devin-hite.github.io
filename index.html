        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>Ever since beginning my studies at San Francisco State University, I have been working hard to support myself while studying. My most beloved part of learning Math and Physics was getting to work with numbers. I recently decided to take a hiatus from working and dive full-time into an immersive data science course with General Assembly. I look forward to being able to apply my skills and passion for telling a story with data and numbers into a career full of opportunities.</p>
        
        <p>In the past, I felt that I never had room for growth which is something that I am looking to change. I would like to work in a role that involves constant learning and possibility for achieving higher positions. Through my course in GA, I have had exposure to many forms of digital modelling and would like to expand my repertoire.</p>
        
        <p>I have worked in several jobs that involved working on a team and being at times being a leader. I mostly enjoyed being able to contribute to large-scale results and feeling a strong sense companionship. I intend to bring those skills to any new position and look forward to the chance.</p>
